My research interest include multi-sector partnerships for public health emergencies and natural disasters. Since New York City is experiencing one of the worst epidemics in the last 100 years (characterization dependent, of course); I wanted to highlight where Essential Services could be found.

My initial idea was to include all Essential services, but my audience was not geared towards the policy analyst, but the lay person. Therefore, it was important to highlight the two services that anyone would need in a global pandemic â€“ food and health services.

The aim is for any user to be able to click the map and be able to find health and food essential services within a mile.
