The project map the main supply chain  of the global garment industry, focusing on the brands Adidas and H&M. The aim is to provide  a visual understanding of the inequalities of the industry with the use of a friendly informational platform. Within this map, it will be possible to understand who are the main actors, winners and losers of the fast fashion industry.
